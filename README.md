# ELK-BLEDOM-web-app

Web app for controlling ELK-BLEDOM Bluetooth LED strips using the Web Bluetooth API.

- Open the index.html file in a browser (I recommend Chrome). If you host the files on a web server, it has to be accessed through https otherwise will lack the proper permissions for API.
- Click "Connect" button,
- Select the "ELK-BLEDOM" device from the list.
